Brains are purpose-driven. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) sets goals, plans, monitors progress, and adjusts to feedback. Agents need an equivalent Goal Setting and Monitoring pattern to move from reactive to proactive.

### Human Analogy

- Goal Setting: “Master calculus in two weeks.”
- Planning: Subgoals — integrals, practice, mocks.
- Monitoring: Notice when stuck or behind.
- Feedback Loop: Success strengthens strategy; failures trigger adjustment.

### Translating to Agents

- Goal = final objective.
- Subgoals = decomposition.
- Monitoring = progress tracking and feedback signals.
- Adjustment = replanning on failures.

### Practical Applications

Customer support resolution, personalized tutoring, trading bots (risk vs. gain), autonomous navigation, and project management.

### Code as Synthetic PFC

Self-reviewing agents that iterate until criteria are met implement the PFC loop: define goals → draft → monitor feedback → refine → stop on success.

### Key Design Lessons

1. Use SMART goals.
2. Keep feedback loops continuous.
3. Separate roles (planner, reviewer, tester) to reduce self-blindness.
4. Treat failures as replanning signals.

### Conclusion

Goal setting and monitoring turn raw intelligence into purposeful, self-correcting action.
