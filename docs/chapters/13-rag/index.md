Human memory is dynamic recall and reconstruction; the hippocampus retrieves fragments and reassembles them. Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) provides agents with hippocampal recall: fetch context from external sources and ground responses.

### Neuroscience Analogy

- Encoding: Experiences as distributed traces → text chunks embedded into vectors.
- Cue‑based Recall: Cues trigger search → query embeddings match vector DB.
- Reconstruction: Fragments form episodes → retrieved chunks augment prompts.
- Error Risks: Human confabulation ↔ LLM hallucination when retrieval fails.

### Core RAG Mechanisms

1. Embeddings for semantic meaning.
2. Semantic search over memory traces.
3. Chunking to manage working memory.
4. Hybrid search (vector + BM25) for robustness.
5. Augmentation into working memory (prompt).

### From Passive to Agentic RAG

Deliberate memory search via:

- Source validation (current/authoritative docs).
- Conflict resolution (reconcile contradictions).
- Decomposition into sub‑questions.
- Knowledge gap detection (fetch external input).

### Applications

Enterprise assistants (policies, manuals), customer support, personalized learning, research assistants, real‑time decision support.

### Challenges

Fragmentation, noise, contradictions, and latency. Like human recall, imperfect yet essential.

### Conclusion

RAG grounds agent reasoning in verifiable knowledge. Agentic RAG turns lookup into active memory search capable of filtering, reconciling, and updating knowledge in real time.
