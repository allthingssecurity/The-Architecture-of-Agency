## The Metabolic Brain of Agents: Resource-Aware Optimization

Brains and agents have limited energy. Resource‑Aware Optimization is cognitive budgeting: adapt strategy to compute, time, and cost constraints, balancing fast heuristics and slow deliberation.

### Neuroscience Analogy

- System 1 vs. System 2: Fast vs. slow thinking.
- Neural efficiency: Experts use less energy with optimized pathways.
- Sleep consolidation: Reorganize knowledge for efficient retrieval.

### Strategies

1. Dynamic Model Switching (small vs. large models).
2. Fallback Mechanisms (cheaper alternatives on throttle).
3. Contextual Pruning & Summarization.
4. Adaptive Tool Selection.
5. Resource Forecasting.
6. Graceful Degradation.

### Applications

Cost‑constrained support, latency‑sensitive trading, energy‑aware edge agents, load‑balanced multi‑agent systems.

### Conclusion

Intelligence isn’t just solving problems — it’s doing so economically, investing effort where it matters.
