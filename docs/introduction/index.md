# Introduction

Intelligent agents are unlike conventional programs. Traditional software runs predefined instructions with predictable outcomes. Agents, however, interact with environments, learn from feedback, and adapt their strategies. They reason, act, and reflect — often producing results that go beyond what was explicitly coded.

This flexibility is both powerful and risky. Without careful design, agents may generate harmful outputs, drift away from goals, or act in ways their creators never intended. Building robust agents therefore requires a balance: give them freedom to reason and explore, while embedding mechanisms to monitor, constrain, and correct their behavior.

That is where design patterns for agent intelligence come in. Patterns capture recurring solutions to common challenges, distilling them into reusable frameworks. Inspired by how humans think and adapt — drawing from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science — these patterns guide the construction of reliable, safe, and capable AI systems.

In this book, we explore key dimensions of agent intelligence:

- Reasoning techniques that enable multi-step, explainable problem solving.
- Guardrails that protect against unsafe or biased outputs.
- Evaluation and monitoring frameworks that continuously track performance.
- Exploration and discovery mechanisms that let agents move beyond known boundaries into new knowledge.

Together, these form a cognitive architecture where curiosity is balanced by caution, and capability is anchored by trust.
